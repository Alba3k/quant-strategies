## 🚀 Included Strategies

### 🔁 EMA + RSI Strategy

This strategy combines two key technical indicators:

- **EMA13 vs EMA30**: Measures short-term vs long-term trend direction
- **RSI (Relative Strength Index)**: Gauges momentum and potential overbought/oversold conditions

#### 📊 Signal Logic

| Signal Type | Condition | Interpretation |
|-------------|-----------|----------------|
| 🟢 **Buy (LONG)** | `EMA13 > EMA30` and `RSI > 50` | Uptrend confirmed and momentum strong |
| 🔴 **Sell (SHORT)** | `EMA13 < EMA30` and `RSI < 50` | Downtrend confirmed and momentum weak |

The strategy generates a position signal (`LONG` or `SHORT`) only when **both conditions align**, reducing noise and false entries.
